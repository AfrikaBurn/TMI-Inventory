# Reporting Bugs

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr) for bugs and feature requests. Please do NOT post usage or installation questions there, it is not a forum!

Guidelines:
* Create one issue per bug or feature request
* Do not mix multiple bugs or feature requests into a single issue
* Search the issue tracker if the issue has already been reported
* Ensure you are running the latest version of PartKeepr
* Try to reproduce the problem on [demo.partkeepr.org](demo.partkeepr.org) prior reporting the issue and indicate in the issue that you have done so


Use the dedicated mailing list or IRC for general questions as described on the [PartKeepr Support Page](https://www.partkeepr.org/support/).
