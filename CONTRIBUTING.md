# Reporting Bugs

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr) for bugs and feature requests. Please do NOT post usage or installation questions there, it is not a forum!

Guidelines:

 * Create _one issue per bug or feature request_
 * _Do not mix_ multiple bugs or feature requests into a single issue
 * _Search the issue tracker_ if the issue has already been reported
 * Ensure you are running the latest version of PartKeepr
 * Try to reproduce the problem on [demo.partkeepr.org](demo.partkeepr.org) prior reporting the issue and indicate in the issue that you have done so
 * Report your _browser type and version_, any _JavaScript errors in the console_ and any other details like _server operating system_, _php version_ etc.


Use the dedicated mailing list or IRC for general questions as described on the [PartKeepr Support Page](https://www.partkeepr.org/support/).
